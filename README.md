Web-Search-Engines-HW-2
=======================

1. The run speed of the indexing vary accoss machines. On linserv1 it is pretty slow but we tried on local machine and crunchy1 too. It works very fast there.

2. Index for doconly and occurance will take some time to load on linserv, However if you try the same index on crunchy1 with same memory constraints it will load fast and will work fine.

3. Please use %22 for quotes

4. We have also attached a make file which can be used to compile and run the code. There are two modes.
   make index and make run . This includes the class path  for jsoup.

If there is any issue in runing the code please feel free to contact us
